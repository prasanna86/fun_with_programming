The idea for this Kata came from 9gag today. You'll have to translate a string to Pilot's alphabet (NATO phonetic alphabet). Like this:

Input: If you can read
Output: India Foxtrot Yankee Oscar Uniform Charlie Alfa November Romeo Echo Alfa Delta

Some notes

    Keep the punctuation, and remove the spaces.
    Use Xray without dash or space.

Reference
