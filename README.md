# fun_with_programming

This repository will have some interesting/fun/simple/medium/hard questions in programming I came across. 
I'll often update a "_simpler" solution version for these questions as and when I learn and rethink newer 
and more efficient ways to solve the same question. Where unclear, I'll update with additional comments 
for clarity.
