# fun_with_programming
This repository will have some interesting/fun/simple/medium/hard questions in programming I came across. I'll often update a "_simpler" solution version for these questions as and when I learn and rethink newer and more efficient ways to solve the same question. Where unclear, I'll update with additional comments for clarity.
